# Soil_Health
This Project predicts soil fertility (either high or moderate) based on environmental and chemical factors.

# Overview
Using machine learning, this model evaluates various parameters of soil and its surroundings to classify fertility.
Some of the parameters are:
- Photoperiod
- Light Intensity
- Temperature
- Relative Humudity (Rh)
- Rainfall
- pH
- Nitrogen ratio etc.
